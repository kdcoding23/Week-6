Promineo Tech's Week 6 assignment was to create an automated version of the card game WAR. The criteria was to:

- Deal 26 Cards to 2 Players from a Deck.
- Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
- Award a point to the Player with the higher Card.
- Make ties result in zero points for both Players.
- Have it that after all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
- Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions.
